# Welcome to Vannoli Marco github 
The repository is dedicated to machine learning, in particulary to the image-classification of weather conditions. Inside it, you will find the code implemented and the image classified through model trained. The images have been producted by my self.
# Report about it
The report producted by my self you can find inside the repository. Enjoy!
# Info about me
I am a student at the faculty of Artificial Inteligent and robotics of Sapienza (Rome). I am originally from Subiaco (RM) and I am passionate about the world of robotics and artificial intelligence, I am always active and enthusiastic when there is a new project to do, like this one!
